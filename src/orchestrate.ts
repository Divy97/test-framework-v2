// The host side of M4: one container per participant, sequenced here.
//
// This does not contradict M3.1's "no docker client in the sandbox" — the
// sandbox still has none. Orchestration moves UP, to the host, which already
// has a daemon. What moves with it is the thing that mattered: base and fix stop
// sharing a machine.
//
// Six review rounds established the shape of the problem. Every fix that scrubbed
// a shared channel was correct and was followed by another way in, because
// per-participant directories and a best-effort process sweep are approximations
// of isolation. A container is not an approximation: there is no tree to inherit,
// no TMPDIR to seed, no HOME to plant in, no process to outlive a boundary, and
// no window on the evidence store between phases.
//
// Only two things cross between containers, both explicitly: the commits (via
// the read-only source mount) and the seq counter.
//
// The evidence store is the exception that had to be built, not assumed. Mounted
// straight through, it defeated the whole point: the base container flushes
// before it exits, the fix container mounts the same directory, `guardEvidence`
// treats those blobs as pre-existing and never evicts them, and a bind mount
// does not honour container permissions — so a repro could read them and be red
// once, green after. That is strictly WORSE than the whole-run path, where blobs
// sit in root-owned staging until the last repro has finished. So each container
// gets its own empty store and the host collects from it afterwards. Blobs are
// content-addressed, so collecting is a copy that cannot collide meaningfully.
